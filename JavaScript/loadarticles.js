The program offers a unique opportunity for junior members of the ESAO to gain research experience and training in different environments, improve their scientific knowledge and establish international and interdisciplinary cooperation.<br><br> The yESAO Exchange Program is a two-step program where two young researchers from different institutes collaborate on a short project, with each researcher spending at least one week in the host institute of the other researcher. The program offers funding of €750 for each researcher to cover eligible costs associated with the exchange. The program is open only to ESAO junior members interested in improving their scientific knowledge and cooperation.<br><br> The application process for the program is simple and requires a complete application consisting of a cover page, an exchange proposal written by the two researchers involved, a curriculum vitae of the two researchers, a letter of support from the supervisors of the two hosting institutes, and an ESAO junior membership application form (if not already a member). The deadline for applications is February 20th, 2023, and all documents should be submitted to yesao@esao.org.<br><br> The evaluation process will be conducted by three reviewers nominated by the yESAO executive committee, who will evaluate the applications based on the quality of content, novelty of the problem, quality of working plan, and exchange of methods. The two exchange projects with the highest scores will be funded by ESAO.<br><br> After the exchange program, the researchers enrolled in the program will be required to prepare a final report (2 pages) of the exchange experience and submit it to yESAO. They will also be required to make an oral presentation on the experience at the ESAO meeting. Participants are encouraged to submit an abstract to the ESAO conference if relevant scientific results arise from the exchange program.<br><br> The yESAO Exchange Award is an opportunity for young researchers to gain experience, collaborate with other researchers, and establish international and interdisciplinary cooperation. The program will help participants enhance their research skills and provide them with a platform to present their research findings at the main ESAO congress in September 2023.",
