                <h2>yESAO to Host Our First-Ever Webinar on Artificial Organs and Early Career Research Skills</h2>

                <p>The European Society for Artificial Organs (ESAO) is excited to announce that we are currently in the process of organising our first-ever webinar. This is a significant milestone for the society and a fantastic opportunity for researchers in the field of artificial organs to come together and share their knowledge and experiences.<br><br>

                The webinar will focus on a range of topics related to artificial organs research, including new technologies, innovative research projects, and emerging trends in the field. Attendees will have the opportunity to learn from leading experts in the field and engage in lively discussions and debates on the latest research findings.<br><br>
                    
                At this stage, we are still in the planning phase and have not yet opened registration for the webinar. However, we encourage all members of the ESAO and those interested in artificial organs research to stay tuned for further updates and information.<br><br>
                    
                We are working hard to ensure that this webinar is a success and a valuable experience for all attendees. Our team is currently finalising details of the programme and speakers, and we will provide further information on the registration process as soon as possible.<br><br>
                    
                This webinar is just one of the many exciting initiatives that the ESAO is working on to advance the field of artificial organs and promote collaboration among researchers. We are committed to creating opportunities for young researchers to develop their skills and knowledge, and to providing a platform for established experts to share their expertise.<br><br>
                    
                Stay tuned for further updates on this exciting opportunity for the artificial organs research community. We look forward to welcoming you to our first-ever webinar and to sharing our knowledge and experiences with one another.</p>

                <h2>The yESAO Exchange Award 2023: Experience International Research and Cooperation</h2>

                <p>The European Society for Artificial Organs (ESAO) has announced the launch of the yESAO Exchange Award 2023, aimed at promoting research collaboration between young researchers of the ESAO community. The program offers a unique opportunity for junior members of the ESAO to gain research experience and training in different environments, improve their scientific knowledge and establish international and interdisciplinary cooperation.<br><br>
                The yESAO Exchange Program is a two-step program where two young researchers from different institutes collaborate on a short project, with each researcher spending at least one week in the host institute of the other researcher. The program offers funding of â‚¬750 for each researcher to cover eligible costs associated with the exchange. The program is open only to ESAO junior members interested in improving their scientific knowledge and cooperation.<br><br>
                    
                The application process for the program is simple and requires a complete application consisting of a cover page, an exchange proposal written by the two researchers involved, a curriculum vitae of the two researchers, a letter of support from the supervisors of the two hosting institutes, and an ESAO junior membership application form (if not already a member). The deadline for applications is February 20th, 2023, and all documents should be submitted to yesao@esao.org.<br><br>
                    
                The evaluation process will be conducted by three reviewers nominated by the yESAO executive committee, who will evaluate the applications based on the quality of content, novelty of the problem, quality of working plan, and exchange of methods. The two exchange projects with the highest scores will be funded by ESAO.<br><br>
                    
                After the exchange program, the researchers enrolled in the program will be required to prepare a final report (2 pages) of the exchange experience and submit it to yESAO. They will also be required to make an oral presentation on the experience at the ESAO meeting. Participants are encouraged to submit an abstract to the ESAO conference if relevant scientific results arise from the exchange program.<br><br>
                    
                The yESAO Exchange Award is an opportunity for young researchers to gain experience, collaborate with other researchers, and establish international and interdisciplinary cooperation. The program will help participants enhance their research skills and provide them with a platform to present their research findings at the main ESAO congress in September 2023. The call for applications for the yESAO Exchange Award 2023 opens on December 1st, 2022. Don't miss out on this opportunity to exchange ideas and gain new research experiences!<br><br>

                <h2>yESAO Conference 2022 Austria, Krems - A Huge Success!</h2>

                <p>The European Society for Artificial Organs (ESAO) and the young ESAO researchers group (yESAO) would like to extend our sincerest gratitude to the hosts and participants of the ESAO Conference that took place in Krems, Austria on September 6th-10th, 2022. <br><br>

                The conference was a resounding success, with a multitude of experts in the field of artificial organs presenting and sharing their knowledge and research. Attendees were treated to an array of informative talks, engaging discussions, and lively debates, as well as the opportunity to network with fellow researchers and professionals.<br><br>
                    
                ESAO and yESAO would like to extend a special thank you to the conference hosts and organizers, whose hard work and dedication made this event possible. Without their efforts, this valuable opportunity for education and collaboration would not have been possible.<br><br>
                    
                Additionally, we would like to thank all of the conference participants for their attendance and contributions. Your active engagement in the conference made for a stimulating and productive event.<br><br>
                    
                As we reflect on the success of the 2022 ESAO Conference, we look forward to the future of the field of artificial organs and the continued growth and development of ESAO and yESAO. Once again, we extend our gratitude to all who participated and made this event a success.
