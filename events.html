  <h2>1st Cloudy-yESAO 2020: A Successful Digital Conference Amidst Unprecedented Times</h2>
  <p>We're pleased to announce that this year's yESAO event, the "Cloudy-yESAO," was a great success! Due to the circumstances, the event took place in an altered form as a digital online conference from September 7th to 11th, 2020. Despite the changes, the format still included traditional elements, such as scientific sessions and workshops, with novel elements enabled by the online conference concept. We were thrilled to have 100 participants, with 24 scientific presentations, 4 special talks about research during the pandemic, two great keynotes, and one digital workshop. The core team had much fun throughout the event and appreciated the enthusiasm and support of all the participants. Thanks to everyone who participated in making this year's yESAO a great success, and we look forward to continuing the momentum in future events.</p>
