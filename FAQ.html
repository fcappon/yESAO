                <h2>General:</h2>
                <p><strong>Q: What are the benefits I get from a yESAO membership?</strong></p>
                <p>A: As a yESAO member, you will get connected to a network of like-minded peers in the field of artificial organs. This greatly facilitates knowledge exchange across borders and may help to join forces on specific research questions. Further, with the yESAO membership you are eligible to apply for the yESAO Exchange Award, which will provide financial support for a short research stay abroad. With the yESAO membership, you are furthermore typically eligible for a reduced registration fee for the annual yESAO meeting where the yESAO community meets to discuss the latest scientific findings.</p>
                <p>Please visit the section "Membership" on our official website for more information: <a href="https://youngesao.com/membership" target="_blank">https://youngesao.com/membership</a>.</p>

Applicants need to find a collaborating host research institution for the exchange and submit a short application in compliance with the advertised call for submission. The opening of the next call for submissions will be advertised on Linkedin and on the yESAO Website.</p>
